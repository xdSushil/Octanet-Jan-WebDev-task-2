# Octanet-Jan-WebDev-task-2
This is the code for a To-Do list webpage which uses HTML and CSS3 and javascript to dynamically add, delete and mark as done when a task is completed.
It includes features like:
1. Providing number of days left for the task.
2. Tasks with higher priority have a different colour.
3. Alerts the user when the deadline is exceeded.
