This is the code for a To-Do list webpage which uses HTML and CSS3 and javascript to dynamically add, delete and mark as done when a task is completed.
The webpage includes features like:
1. Providing number of days left for the task.
2. Tasks with higher priority have a different colour and are positioned higher.
3. Tasks are sorted based on priority.
4. Alerts the user when the deadline is exceeded.
5. Provides a progress bar for you to update progress of your tasks in real-time.
